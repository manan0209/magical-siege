# Magical Siege

**Week 6 Project for Siege**  

This is a Chrome extension that transforms the Siege experience into a magical one, i have invested a lot of time in hit and trial, by trying out different ui upgrades and features, dug too deep into siege code for that :cryin: but good thing is that I have fairly good idea about siege web structure now, after multiple versions and trials, I have kinda accepted how keep and armory page have been upgraded as of now, I have also tried to make a magical theme for the website do try it out, I'll keep working on this one, to make it much more useful and upgrade siege into truly a magical experience :)

## Features as of now (Implemented succesfully)

### Magical themes
I have implemented two more themes, magical and a dark theme do check them out :)

### Live Deadline Countdown
A live countdown according to edt, to keep you on your feet :)

### Better stats on keep
I have tried to improved the stats in keep page, so that you have better experience sieging!

### Armory upgrades
Armory page is upgraded now with predicted coins, and project stats that will help you, It's still work in progress, i am working on more features

### Keyboard shortcuts
yeah i added some keyboard shortcut as well, idk how they are better, but it seemed cool to me :)

## Future (yet to be implemented)

I did try some of these but they were broken, so I am not shipping them yet!

### Voting Tools
Vote faster and fairer with ai detection, and ai comparison for all projects for maybe better star rating

### shop upgrades
I maybe able to give some shop items for free (Olive dont kill me for that :hehe:) also a better shop layout maybe

# Magical Siege

This project is an update!

week 10 update :

What i did -> is that i made a treasury managing grid which is inspired by refineing work in severence, once you click treasury button, you become treasurer and you have to process siege treasury by processing coins in the grid!

I had many awesome ideas and plans for this week, but unfortunately I was very busy giving mocks back to back :sob: so couldnt really implement all of the features i planned, but still i consider it has turned out to be great, give it a try, and always remember since you are a treasurer now that work is mysterious and improtant!!

week 9 update:
Olive rewrote the code and my extension broke, i had to spend so much time figuring how to fix it, going blind as i dont have access to updated code yet, so i used popstate to handle turbo fires, kinda rebuilt the extension then moved on to fix some pending broken things, and finally (even i cant believe this turned out to be so good) the dark theme is now spooky as hell, i would suggest you to follow the dot!!

(also i am proud of myself i didnt buy any merc this week nor begged for coins lol! :)_

It's 2 am now cupcakes signin off... Happy Halloween!

week 8 update:
I have fixed the issues created duw to olive rewriting some code in og website, made armory upgrades, fixed the broken structure, and most importantly now lb uses api to fetch top 50, and then counts you (if you are not in top 50), also added search in explore page, and most amazing update in this version that i personally love is falling projects, they turned out to be so cool, you can clickable as well, hope you all like this update (prolly a final one!)

This is a Chrome extension that transforms the Siege experience into a magical one, i have invested a lot of time in hit and trial, by trying out different ui upgrades and features, dug too deep into siege code for that :cryin: but good thing is that I have fairly good idea about siege web structure now, after multiple versions and trials, I have kinda accepted how keep and armory page have been upgraded as of now, I have also tried to make a magical theme for the website do try it out, I'll keep working on this one, to make it much more useful and upgrade siege into truly a magical experience :)

what I improved in week 7 (signal theme):
I improved themes (dont tell Olive but in magical theme you get orange meeple for free with this one :lol), added a coffers leaderboard, and a poke(signal) feature to poke others, sadly I was out this week so couldn't work much as I wanted to! Now that apis are finally out, I can't wait to use them in week 8, here are some snapshots!
